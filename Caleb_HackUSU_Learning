plt.plot(x, y)

'''
Okay, so minor issue: the code runs but nothing is output ot the terminal..
    Added block = true
        Still don't display....
    Added plt.savefig("plot.png")
        Running but still no display...

This code didnt end up running, so I did my best to troubleshoot it. plt.show takes booleen arguments, 
so I tried to put in true and false. I also tried to put in block=true and block=false. It didnt run so I
turned to ChatGPT. The code it gave is below.

z = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
